# AI Assistance Documentation


## AI Usage Details

### AI Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-4 & 4.1)**: For code generation, problem solving, and documentation.
- **GitHub Copilot**: For in-editor code suggestions and boilerplate.
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: For alternative code suggestions and explanations.

### Effective Prompts
- "Fix TypeScript error: Not all code paths return a value."
- "Generate a responsive Next.js header with Tailwind."
- "Suggest a reusable Card component with variants."
- "How to configure Tailwind v4 with Next.js 14?"
- "Fixed a lot of build errors with assist of Kimi K2"

### AI-Generated/Assisted Code Sections
- `src/components/layout/navigation.tsx` (logic, state, and JSX structure)
- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` and `Card.tsx` (variants, props, and JSX structure)
- `tailwind.config.ts` (custom breakpoints and theme), it is not not needed i just put it here because on my local machine css peak and Tailwind Intellisense was not working
- Utility functions in `src/lib/utils.ts`
- Type definitions in `src/types/` A lil bit

### Validation of AI-Generated Code
- Manual code review for clarity and correctness (removed a lot of code which was generated by prompts)
- TypeScript compiler checks (strict mode)
- ESLint linting for code quality
- Next.js build (`npm run build`) to ensure no runtime/type errors
- Visual inspection in browser for UI/UX correctness

### Challenges Solved by AI
- Debugging TypeScript errors (e.g., missing return values)
- Setting up Tailwind CSS v4 with Next.js 14 and PostCSS
- Refactoring components for better reusability and type safety
- Improving accessibility and responsive design
- Resolving build and lint errors quickly
